        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <p>
         Born and raised in Barrie, Ontario, I began my life in early spring of 1999. Born into a family with 2 older boys, I was set up to fight for a way to be heard! My younger years were battled out between the 3 of us, but those days eventually came to end when I began my high school career in 2014. I finished my elementary years at Saint John Paul in Barrie, then I went across the street to Saint Peter's High School. One of the first things I discovered upon my arrival to secondary school was my <em>undeniable</em>, <em>unfathomable</em> and <em> uncontrollable</em> love for the automotive industry. I bought my first car a few weeks into high school, before I even had my license; I wouldn't wait a <em>day</em> past my 16th birthday to take my driver's license exam. And thus, a hobby was born.

         Fast forward to today, and most of my achievements and goals relate back to the hobby I started almost <em>10</em> years ago. My first car, a 1987 Honda CRX, is <em>still</em> with me, and is an ongoing project on it's way to being my personal racecar. In addition to my Honda, I've added 3 more cars to my current collection and have went through <em>many</em> more cars in between. These recent achievements were only made possible with my successful side-hust-turned-main-hustle that allowed me to quit my full time job. These past few years have been remarkable for me in terms of personal growth and success.

         My future goals for myself are largely focused on my education. I'm looking forward to expanding my horizions and opening myself up for more opportunities I wouldn't otherwise be allowed without it. I hope to return after my course is over to even further my education. In the meantime, I will continue to enjoy my hobbies and let my interests show me new opportunities every day. They have allowed me to find my boyfriend of almost 5 years through mutual hobbies so I look forward to seeing what else is in store. I hope to buy a house (with a <em>big</em> garage) with my future husband when I graduate, adopt 2 dogs and live happily, ever after.
