        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <p>
         Born and raised in Barrie, Ontario, I began my life in early spring of 1999. Born into a family with 2 older boys, I was set up to fight for a way to be heard! My younger years were battled out between the 3 of us, but those days eventually came to end when I began my high school career in 2014. I finished my elementary years at Saint John Paul in Barrie, then I went across the street to Saint Peter's High School. One of the first things I discovered upon my arrival to secondary school was my <em>undeniable</em>, <em>unfathomable</em> and <em> uncontrollable</em> love for the automotive industry. I bought my first car a few weeks into high school, before I even had my license; I wouldn't wait a <em>day</em> past my 16th birthday to take my driver's license exam. And thus, a hobby was born.
