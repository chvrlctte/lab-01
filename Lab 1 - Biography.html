        <h2>Biography</h2>

        <p>
         Born and raised in Barrie, Ontario, I began my life in early spring of 1999. Born into a family with 2 older boys, I was set up to fight for a way to be heard! My younger years were battled out between the 3 of us, but those days eventually came to end when I began my high school career in 2014. I finished my elementary years at Saint John Paul in Barrie, then I went across the street to Saint Peter's High School. One of the first things I discovered upon my arrival to secondary school was my <em>undeniable</em>, <em>unfathomable</em> and <em> uncontrollable</em> love for the automotive industry. I bought my first car a few weeks into high school, before I even had my license; I wouldn't wait a <em>day</em> past my 16th birthday to take my driver's license exam. And thus, a hobby was born.

         Fast forward to today, and most of my achievements and goals relate back to the hobby I started almost <em>10</em> years ago. My first car, a 1987 Honda CRX, is <em>still</em> with me, and is an ongoing project on it's way to being my personal racecar. In addition to my Honda, I've added 3 more cars to my current collection and have went through <em>many</em> more cars in between. These recent achievements were only made possible with my successful side-hust-turned-main-hustle that allowed me to quit my full time job. These past few years have been remarkable for me in terms of personal growth and success.
